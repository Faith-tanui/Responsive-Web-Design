      <p id="quote">Mandela's name has become synonymous with the selfless struggle for liberty and democracy, the unwavering pursuit of equality and social injustice.<br>
One of his most famous quotes was: <i>“What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made in the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we led.”</i> By those terms, few can lay claim to having made a more significant contribution than this great man, a true legend.</p>
      <h2>Here is a timeline of Nelson Mandela's life:</h2>
      <fieldset id="tribute-info" class="timeline">
     <p><b>1918:</b> Born Rolihlahla Mandela on the 18th of July in South Africa</p>
      <p><b>1918- 1934:</b> Early childhood. Mandela attended a local methodist school when he was about seven. Baptised a methodist, he was given the English name "Nelson" by his teacher.</p>
       <p><b>1934-1940:</b> Mandela began his secondary education at Claekebury and after completing his Junior certificate joines Fort Beaufort college in 1937. In 1939, he began his BA degree at the University of Fort Hare where he befriended Oliver Tambo and K.D. Matanzima. Although he had friends who had connections to the ANC(Africa National Congress), Mandela distanced himself from the movement. In his second year, he was suspended from the university for being involved in a boycott led by the SRC(Student Representative Council).</p>
       <p><b>1943-1949:</b> Mandela joined the University of Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student. Mandela met Evelyn Mase, with whom they entered a relationship and got married in October 1944.In 1947, Mandela was elected to the executive commitee of ANC's Transvaal Province branch. In 1948, during the South African general election in which only whites were allowed to vote, Mandela and his party started advocating direct action against apartheid. Having devoted his time to politics, Mandela failed his final year at witwatersrand and ultimately denied a degree in December 1949. </p>
       <p><b>1950-1954:</b> In 1950, Mandela was elected national president of the ANCYL.In 1952, he began working at H.M. Basner law firm owned by a communist.He was arrested under the Suppression of communism Act and stood trial among 20 other accused.They were found guilty and sentenced to 9 months of hard-labour which was suspended for 2 years. </p>
       <p><b>1955-1961:</b>After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. In December 1956, Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC national executive and accused of "high treason" against the state. Held in Johannesburg Prison amid mass protests, they underwent a preparatory examination before being granted bail.The formal Treason Trial began in Pretoria in August 1958, with the defendants successfully applying to have the three judges—all linked to the governing National Party—replaced. In August, one charge was dropped, and in October the prosecution withdrew its indictment, submitting a reformulated version in November which argued that the ANC leadership committed high treason by advocating violent revolution, a charge the defendants denied.</p>
       <p><b>1962-1964:</b> On 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick. The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar. The trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the United Nations and World Peace Council, while the University of London Union voted Mandela to its presidency.On 12 June 1964, justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment. </p>
       <p><b>1962-1982:</b> In 1964, Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years.</p>
       <p><b>1982-1988:</b> In April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island.Mandela requested talks with Botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee in 1987, and having a further 11 meetings over the next three years. Coetsee organised negotiations between Mandela and a team of four government figures starting in May 1988; the team agreed to the release of political prisoners and the legalisation of the ANC on the condition that they permanently renounce violence, break links with the Communist Party, and not insist on majority rule. Mandela rejected these conditions, insisting that the ANC would end its armed activities only when the government renounced violence</p>
       <p><b>1988-1990:</b> Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release.Leaving Victor Verster Prison on 11 February, Mandela held Winnie's hand in front of amassed crowds and the press; the event was broadcast live across the world. This marked the beginning of the end of the Apartheid.</p>
